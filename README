TrelloActivityNotifier

TrelloActivityNotifier is a Chrome browser extension that adds functionality to notify the user of any activity happening on the Trello board. In v0.2, it does the following :
 - Updates the browser title when new Activity is added to the Board.
 - Highlights unread items in the Activity Stream on the right side of the board. Clicking anywhere in the window would mark them as read.
 - Highlights the cards which have unread activity on the board. Opening the card will mark them as read.


Installation :
Save all the files in this folder to a folder on your disk. Use Chrome's Extension's Developer mode to load unpacked extensions in that folder.

I also acknowledge that this extension might not be useful once Trello adds some advanced Notification-related features. If someone wants to publish this to the Chrome Web Store, please feel free, but please give some credit to me too.

Acknowledgements : The SoylentGreen Dev team at TheLadders for beta-testing this extension and their valuable input on the features.

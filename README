TrelloActivityNotifier

TrelloActivityNotifier is a Chrome browser extension that adds functionality to notify the user of any activity happening on the Trello board. In v0.2, it does the following :
 - Updates the browser title when new Activity is added to the Board.
 - Highlights unread items in the Activity Stream on the right side of the board. Clicking anywhere in the window would mark them as read.
 - Highlights the cards which have unread activity on the board. Opening the card will mark them as read.

Installation :
Option 1) : Download & open the .crx file in your Chrome browser to install it.
Option 2) : Save all the files in this folder to a folder on your disk. Use Chrome's Extension's Developer mode to load unpacked extensions in that folder.

If someone wants to publish this to the Chrome Web Store, please feel free, but please give me credit too.

Acknowledgements : The SoylentGreen Dev team at TheLadders for beta-testing this extension and their valuable input on the features.
